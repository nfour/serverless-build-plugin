> A **Node.js** focused build optimizer plugin for [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless).

Replaces packaging functionality for Node.JS functions. \
Typically this will result in significant size reductions, especially with **webpack**

- **Bundling** of functions in a Node.js friendly way
- Arbitrary builds, with your own build file or a **webpack** config.
